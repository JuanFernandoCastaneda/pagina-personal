There is not much to say. In my search for a job I had to also search for an opportunity to stand out. Given that I have no experience developing, my best bet was showcasing my personal projects, but doing it so in Github was more restrictive and less striking than doing a personal website. After all, it would also count as another project, and would showcase my commitment as a developer.

This site was based on a variant of Astro Paper called [Astro Paper 18](https://github.com/yousef8/astro-paper-i18n).
